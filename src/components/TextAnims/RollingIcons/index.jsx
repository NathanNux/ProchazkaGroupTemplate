//WIP: Redo this code to make it to an icon list anim for the main page Sponsors logos and Parnters logos 
//NOTE: This is just a prototype, that is animating texts based on scroll velocity.



//NOTE at the end - Since the scrollY is for the whole page I need to target the current section to make the text move based on the scroll velocity much smaller
// So either way it will save bit of performance and make the text move based on the scroll velocity of the current section
